       <p>Things to know about my persona is that I follow my heart.  For example, in the area that I am passionate about I do not let fear hold me back because I do not want to spend the rest of my life with the words what if. Additionally, I believe in myself If I fail I will get right back up and keep on trying until I get it right. Furthermore, I treat others the way I want to be treated. For instance, I talk to people the way I want to be spoken to; respect people as I wish to be respected. Not to mention, that I look for positivity on all things. In other words, your mind is powerful, and when you fill it with positivity your life naturally becomes positive. Moreover, I am a tough person who has made it through tough times. When times are tough, anyone can run away, but facing problems and working through them makes one stronger. Above all, I am a responsible person. For one thing, I do not blame others or make excuses. I believe the key to success is having discipline and taking responsibility for one's actions.
